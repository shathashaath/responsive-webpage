## Setup/Installation Requirements

To create your own template repository on github

* Clone the github repository using the git clone command from /Desktop
* Create a new repository on github to keep your template
* Using git remote add pair the clone on your desktop with your new repository
* Add, commit, and push, and then you'll have your own copy of the template to do with as you wish

To install this repository into a new project each time, first

* Clone the github repository using the git clone command from /Desktop
* Create a new folder in the Desktop with your project name
* Copy and paste the entire contents of the cloned /bootstrap-jquery-project-template into your new folder (this should not include the .pairs file)
* Move into your new folder and initialize git as normal
* Congrats! You now have a new repo based on this template

Some **DONT'S**

* Don't just rename the cloned git repository - that will mess up future commits.  Do the copy/paste
* If you're using a bootstrap template, don't replace the <head> tag.  Only change the <body> tag.  The templates include code at the top and bottom that bring in js and css we're already including and a bunch we don't use.  If you call a js or css file twice, it causes problems.
